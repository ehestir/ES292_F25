# Think–Pair–Share Activity: Integrating Negligence and Hype

## Context 
In *Science Fictions*, Stuart Ritchie explores how negligence (Chapter 5) and hype (Chapter 6) erode scientific credibility. Negligence reflects careless methods or weak practices, while hype involves overselling results or exaggerating impacts. These two forces often interact, amplifying the risks to both science and society.

## Think (5 minutes, individually)

- Choose one example (real or hypothetical) from your field where you suspect or anticipate examples of negligence and an example of hype
- How do negligence and hype interact? Do you think it damages science?
- Do you think scientists are more likely to get ahead by being careful (avoiding negligence) or by being bold (risking hype)?
- What steps could journals or universities take to reduce both problems together?

- Write a few notes: 

Negligence example: ___________________________________________

Hype interaction: _____________________________________________

Current incentives in my field: _______________________________

## Pair (10 minutes, with a partner)

- Share examples from your own experience
- Identify the sources of where hype is coming from
- Brainstorm ways to communicate research to the public without losing accuracy or attention

- Write a few notes:

What safeguards (training, peer checks, workflows) could realistically reduce negligent errors in research?_________________

Does hype make negligence easie or harder to detect? _________________________

Does this vary across disciplines? ___________________________________________

Proposed solution: ____________________________________________

## Share (10-15 minutes, whole class) 

As a group, can we design one “ideal incentive structure” that rewards careful, rigorous, and impactful science?

## Reflection for later 

What role can *you* play in resisting hype and preventing negligence in your own research practice?

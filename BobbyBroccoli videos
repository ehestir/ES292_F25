Hey all, if the tales of the individual fraudulent researchers in chapter 3 of Science Fictions piqued your interest and you want to dive deeper into some of their stories, you're in luck! Science communicator BobbyBroccoli on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@BobbyBroccoli) has made some incredibly well-crafted, high-effort videos telling the in-depth stories of where these researchers came from, what they did, and how it all came crashing down in the end. Examples that were mentioned in the text include:

"The man who almost faked his way to a Nobel Prize" (Jan Hendrik Sch√∂n, a 3-part series)

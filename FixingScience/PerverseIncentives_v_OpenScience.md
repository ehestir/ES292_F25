# Think–Pair–Share Activity: Perverse Incentives vs. Fixing Science

## Context

In **Science Fictions**, Stuart Ritchie describes how perverse incentives in science (Chapter 7) undermine research quality and then explores possible reforms (Chapter 8) to fix science. But often, the very incentives scientists face directly work against implementing those reforms.

## Think (5 minutes, individually)

- In your own words: How do perverse incentives undermine reforms like open data, preregistration, or replication?

- Choose one tension you think is especially important. Examples:

    - Open data vs. fear of being scooped
    - Replication vs. career advancement
    - Quantity of publications vs. quality of methods
    - Grant pressure vs. high-risk/high-reward science
   
- Write a few notes:

Perverse incentive I see most clearly: ____________________________

Reform it undermines: _________________________________________

Why this tension matters: ______________________________________

## Pair (10 minutes, with a partner)

- Share your tension with your partner.

- Compare: did you pick the same one or different ones?

- Discuss:

    - What’s the underlying systemic issue creating the tension?
    - Have you experienced or observed this in your field?

Partner notes:

Partner’s example: ____________________________________________

Key insight from discussion: ___________________________________

## Share (10–15 minutes, whole class)

As a group, let's identify one practical way universities, funders, or professional societies could resolve the tension you discussed.

- Be concrete (e.g., specific policy, incentive change, or cultural shift).

- Think about feasibility and tradeoffs.

## Reflection for later: 

**Which reforms feel personally actionable for you in your own research?**
